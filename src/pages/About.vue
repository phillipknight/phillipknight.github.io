    <h2>Tinkering with technology and trying to make a difference.</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve worked on campaigns ranging from municipal boards to United States Senate, and with organizations
      from small student groups to the largest LGBT nonprofit in the world. Every professional role I’ve had
      has been different, but my ambition and determination have always been the same: I’m motivated by moving
      the needle- seeing measurable change in a sometimes troubling world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently help campaigns and nonprofit organizations build and manage online technolgy, with a focus
      on connecting people with their leaders around the world. My past experience includes front-line field
      organizing, traditional communications, digital strategy, and a lifetime of nerding out with technology.
